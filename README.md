👋 Hi, I’m Pierre-Etienne, pharmacist and young data scientist.

👀 I’m interested in data exploration and machine learning.
      My language of choice is R (python has not yet equalled ggplot2), but I am not hermetic. 
      I love python, which offers coding possibilities that R does not.
    
💞️ I want to give back to the community what it brings me every day, when my code doesn't want to work.

📫 You can reach me at pierre-etienne.toulemonde@outlook.com, for questions, job offer or proposal for collaboration on a R or python project. 
      Working together is always a great opportunity to do great things!
